[00:15.40] This world, a reality you all believe
[00:20.84] I know that it's clouding what was meant to be
[00:27.52] The space around us starts to bend
[00:30.40] Into an infinite dead end
[00:33.06] Unsure what I should do
[00:34.73] Losing the vision to see what is true
[00:38.33] Is there a god deciding our fate
[00:41.15] Throwing promises away
[00:43.98] In the blink of an eye
[00:45.54] Casting us fast like the endings in sight
[00:48.38] I alone, acting on my own
[00:53.54] All that will matter, I'll rewrite this chapter
[00:56.74] And stand by all I've ever known
[01:00.10] I can fly high
[01:01.49] In the moment there's no time to pause and theorize
[01:04.55] Seize the day, don't let what's precious to you slip
[01:07.45] Don't let the past run away
[01:09.41] And leave you broken, wishing it would come back
[01:12.13] Greater than the pain that you may suffer right now
[01:15.07] Every piece of truth is waiting, soon to be found
[01:17.55] Turning the scene to zero, on this broken track
[01:22.95] There is no god, wonderful new world
[01:41.30] A dream, and the fantasy they call "this life"
[01:46.36] Remains, through delusions of regret and strife
[01:53.60] Contradictions, crossing lines, paradoxes warp the mind
[01:58.99] As the planes separate
[02:00.87] Shattering bonds, twisting worlds, time and space
[02:04.28] Though emotions don't make sense
[02:07.07] They're something I can't forget
[02:09.62] In the grand equation
[02:11.33] Science alone cannot bring a solution
[02:14.17] Now's the time, this act is mine
[02:19.46] Though I may stumble, I know I won't ever crumble
[02:22.54] I'll stop this world and set it right
[02:26.17] I can fly high
[02:27.51] Spoken words and demonstrations of real love
[02:30.07] Memories so clear, they're rising higher above
[02:32.99] I'll never fail like before, I swear you won't be left behind anymore
[02:38.27] Now all that I want is to stay right at your side
[02:40.76] Standing strong against the pressures that may unwind
[02:43.54] I know we'll turn to zero, both my life and yours
[02:48.94] There is no god, wonderful new world
[03:15.80] The place is worth visiting twice
[03:21.18] Heaven suggesting, an ultimate blessing
[03:23.94] I'll connect each world and pay anyway price
[03:30.39] I can fly high
[03:31.64] In the moment there's no time to pause and theorize
[03:34.48] Seize the day, don't let what's precious to you slip by
[03:37.51] Don't let the past run away
[03:39.26] And leave you broken, wishing it would come back
[03:42.26] Greater than the pain that you may suffer right now
[03:45.16] Every piece of truth is waiting, soon to be found
[03:47.93] Turning the scene to zero, on this broken track
[03:53.25] There is no god, wonderful new world
